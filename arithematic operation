The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
Example

a = int(input().strip())
b = int(input().strip())

print(a + b)  # Sum of the two numbers
print(a - b)  # Difference of the two numbers
print(a * b)  # Product of the two numbers
