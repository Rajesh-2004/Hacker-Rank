Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers  and  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer . Print a list of all possible coordinates given by  on a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to . Here, . Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    z = int(input())
    n = int(input())
result = [[i, j, k] for i in range (x+1) for j in range (y+1) for k in range (z+1) if i + j + k != n]
print(result)
